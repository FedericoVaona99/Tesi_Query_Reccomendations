"200","en","The theologian John Mbiti writes: “In Africa I am because we are”. Meaning that only the sense of belonging to a concrete community gives to the individual the elements necessary to define his/her full identity.\n 
Feeling part of the eternal cosmic cycle of life, within which one spends one’s entire existence, life in Africa is under stood as a journey which – marked by specific steps (celebrated by “rites of passage”) – ends up in returning to that “world of the ances- tors and of the spirits” to which everyone  is destined.\n
This explains the reason why in all African cultures the themes of life, fertility, physical and mental health, human relationships and others have great importance and are celebrated in various ways.\n
This also explains the significance of the didactic and ethnographic journey followed by the  African Museum of the Comboni Missionaries, renewed in its content and topics described by the traditional artefacts and traditional handmade objects displayed in the windows; by monothematic exhibitions and by the photos and video-clips constantly running on the large and smaller screens set up inside the museum's halls.\n
Students have also the chance to learn and to develop  skills  by participating in didactic laboratories  organised for them in collaboration with PM - Il Piccolo Missionario, the magazine for children.\n
The African Museum has a threefold aim: to help visitors to meet, to know and to love Africa, that continent far away as well as the one present among us today in Italy. It is the hope and the desire of the curators of the Museum that the great richness of African cultures here expressed may be perceived and appreciated by all those who choose to visit the permanent exhibition.",86

The Palazzo, which has always been the heart of the city, now for the first time hosts the city collections together with those of the Fondazione Cariverona and the Fondazione Domus.\n
This monumental group of buildings, which includes the Torre dei Lamberti, the Cappella dei Notai, and the Scala della Ragione, is now newly open to the city and its visitors. In its four magnificent rooms, hung with masterpieces from the collection, they can discover extraordinary works from 1840 to 1940 that recount the history of Verona, its collections, and their relationship with the city. Among these works are Meditazione by Francesco Hayez, and paintings by Giovanni Fattori, Angelo Morbelli, Felice Casorati , Guido Trentini, Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Gino Rossi, Filippo de Pisis, Giorgio Morandi, as well as sculptures by Medardo Rosso, and Arturo Martini.\n
The new gallery bears the name of the great patron Achille Forti (1887-1937): a botanist of middleclass origins, this notable citizen left the greater part of his assets, the building where he lived, and his art collection to the city of Verona.\n
Thanks to various donations and an acquisitions programme which have enlarged this original nucleus, today the gallery of modern art in Palazzo della Ragione presents itself to Verona and its vast international public immensely enriched, and it confirms that it is one of the locations offering the greatest variety and quality of Italy's visual and artistic heritage.",95

Over centuries many civil and religious buildings were erected on the theatre's ruins; in 1834 a rich Veronese merchant, Andrea Monga, bought at this own expense some of the houses that were built in the area of the theatre in order to begin archaeological excavations, which brought to light ruins of the Roman building.\n
The theatre respects the architectural canons of this building type: the seating area for spectators, divided in two sections and vertically in wedges; the semi-circular orchestra at the foot of the staircase; the stage, for the actors. During the summer the theatre hosts numerous theatrical and musical events (Estate Teatrale Veronese).\n

"50","en","The castle, an imposing civic building from the medieval Veronese period, was built between 1354 and 1356 by order of Cangrande II della Scala. The design was conceived by the della Scala family as a defence against both outside invasions and popular rebellion.The surrounding area allowed for a rapid and easy escape from the city: after crossing the fortified bridge, accessible only to the noble family, the road to the north along the Adige valley was a secure route.The city’s geographically strategic location led to the development of a fortification system, consolidating the remains of the Roman and Commune periods.\n
In 1404, following the brief Carrara and Visconti dominations, the city became part of the Venetian Republic. The castle was used exclusively for military purposes, as a weapons and munitions warehouse and subsequently, in the eighteenth century, became the seat of the Venetian military academy.\n
In the days of the anti-French revolt known as the “Pasque Veronesi” (1797) the castle was the site of numerous armed engagements. The Napoleonic epoch marked the beginning of a radical transformation of the existing structure. The plan provided for the construction of an army barracks around three sides of the drill court, but only those sections along the river and towards the Palazzo Canossa were built. This building, in neo-classical style, continued to serve a military function in the Austrian epoch.\n
Only after 1923 did the castle cease to serve an exclusively military function. It underwent a dramatic structural change, following plans by Antonio Avena, director of the Civic Museums, and the architect Ferdinando Forlati: the reconstruction of the swallowtail battlements, the insertion of late Gothic and Renaissance decorative elements in the facades, and extension of the pictorial decoration in “period” style. Beginning in 1925 the castle became a museum, where valuable art collections were installed.\n
Beginning in 1957, under the direction of Licisco Maganato a new organisation of the entire building was planned, to restore the value of the notable historical and artistic patrimonies. This critical and historical revision favoured authenticity, and thus eliminated the false contexts created in the previous renovation. The task of restoration and museum installation was entrusted to the architect Carlo Scarpa, whose highly original solution is universally recognised as one of the finest examples of museum renovation of post-war Italy.\n
The Museum also holds temporary exhibitions in its Boggian Room (inside the courtyard, on the right).\n",30
"52","en","The Cathedral, which is dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta, is the central structure of a complex of architectural buildings which include San Giovanni in Fonte, Santa Elena, the Canons' cloister, the Capitular library, the square in front of the church and the bishop's residence.\n  
During the Roman Empire, in the area of the present day church, there were villas with private thermal baths (balnea) and probably also a few small temples.\n
The first palaeo Christian basilica was built on the area occupied today by the church of Santa Elena. 
It was consecrated by S. Zeno, bishop of Verona, between 362 380 A.D. but it soon turned out to be too small and a few decades later it was replaced by a larger basilica. Quite a few remains of the mosaic floor of both palaeo Christian basilicas can be seen under the church of Santa Elena and the Canons' cloister.\n
The second palaeo christian basilica collapsed, probably during the 7th century A.D., due to a strong fire or maybe an earthquake. Archdeacon Pacifico was in charge of the reconstruction of the church, between the 8th and the 9th century and the Cathedral, known by the name of Santa Maria Matricolare, was built further south, on the area on which it is situated today.\n
The church was greatly damaged by an earthquake in 1117 A.D. The reconstruction work lasted at least 20 years: the building acquired its current width and the two Romanesque porches.\n
The inside was completely renovated between the second half of the 15th and the second half of the 16th century with the addition of the side chapels and the semicircular choir screen.\n
Note outside the Romanesque façade, Nicolò double level porch (1138), the portal with its lunette and reliefs, the splendid side porch and the apse area.

The only thing never to be completed was the façade. St. Anastasia is the largest church in Verona.\n
The Basilica extends over three large aisles supported by twelve impressive pillars in red Veronese marble. To the left of the transept a splendid marble entrance opens onto the Giusti chapel which was at one time the oratory of the Dominican monastery.\n
The church soars to a great height and the interior is impressive; it is virtually an art gallery which contains many of the works of art Masters often mentioned in art history books. The most important is Pisanello’s well known fresco (St. George and the Princess) above Pellegrini Chapel. Note outside he unfinished façade with the splendid Gothic portal. Inside, you can see altars and chapels with works by Pietro da Porlezza, Cattaneo, Michele da Firenze, LiIberale da Verona, Girolamo dai Libri, Giolfino, Brusasorzi, Altichiero and  Pisanello; at the entrance the singular hunchbacks of the holy water stoup.",40

It is a corner of the city in which various buildings have, over the centuries, been juxtaposed to create a monumental complex that has symbolized, and still symbolizes, the ancient centre.\n
After various renovations, this majestic twelfth-century building has been made available to the public once more.\n
Not only can its architectural and monumental aspects be fully enjoyed, but it has also become the centre of Veronese culture by hosting the Achille Forti gallery of modern art; here, for the first time, the gallery's collection of visual art has been united to the collections of the Fondazione Cariverona and the Fondazione Domus to offer the public both a history and an account of public and private collecting.\n
With this project the Verona city council, together with the Fondazione Cariverona, has made newly available to the city, its inhabitants, and an international public a place that is emblematic of the city and its history.\n
This complex of buildings, whose history, intertwined with that of city life, reaches down the centuries, has today been renewed and given back its rightful place as an organic and harmonic whole, a single body of which the elements composing it are united together: the Palazzo, a symbol of city power; the Torre dei Lamberti, which rises up as an emblem of temporal power; the decorated treasure house of the Cappella dei Notai; and the Scala della Ragione, the heart of the Mercato Vecchio courtyard.\n
The Lamberti tower, built in the twelfth century and so being the same age as the first stages of the Palazzo's construction, rises to 84 metres high and offers a fascinating view of the city and its surroundings; for the Veronese it is a familiar landmark and a visual reference point for the landscape and the city panorama.\n
The courtyard, surrounded by a portico with arches supported by rustic ashlar pillars, is characterized by the colours of alternate courses of bricks and tuff stone. Inside the wide area of the Mercato Vecchio courtyard is the Scala della Ragione, a late gothic jewel built from red Veronese marble which leads the public to the great portal of the first floor, now the new, central access point to the Palazzo's gallery of modern art.\n
This stairway allows a new internal itinerary and, above all, restores the centrality that Camillo Boito had conferred on it at the end of the nineteenth century, restoring it to the ideal role that it originally had.\n
The choice of the Palazzo as the venue for the gallery should be considered a genuine restitution of art to Palazzo della Ragione: in fact in the nineteenth century the first floor was home to the Cignaroli academy of fine art, as is also born out  by the fresco, an allegory of Verona among the Arts, by Giovanni Bevilacqua on the porch at the top of the stairway.",53

Between 755 and 759 St. Annone, the bishop of Verona, recovered from Trieste the mortal remains of the two martyrs and placed them in the Palaeo-Christian church into a “confessione”, the specific place in which people pay honour to the martyrs who have confessed the faith in Christ.\n
Between 1065 and 1143 the Benedictine monks demolished the Palaeo-Christian church and, to conserve the relics in the same place in which St. Annone had placed them, they built a Romanesque church on two levels: the lower church to keep the relics, the upper to be used for religious functions.\n
In 1261 the complex was handed over to the Franciscans, who transformed the upper church into its present form. The work of reconstruction was concluded in the year 1350. Throughout the following centuries, altars, chapels and sepulchral monuments were added.\n
In 1759 the sarcophagus with the mortal remains of the Martyrs was moved to the main altar of the upper church, in order to protect it from the flooding of the river Adige.\n
In 1807 the Franciscans were obliged to leave the monastery because of the Napoleonic conquest. A large part of the monastery passed to the State and the church became a parish assigned to diocesan clergy.\n

The original nucleus of the complex has been identified in the church and convent that rose on the Roman and later an early Christian burial ground near the Via Gallica. The church and convent had been built on the spot where the Saint had been buried, in order to preserve his relics and honor his memory. Saint Zeno, born in Africa, 8th Bishop of Verona (362-380), converted the whole town to Christianity.\n
The early buildings underwent some changes in the 6th century. The church soon became too small, due to the ever growing worship of the Saint. For this reason, the Frankish King Pépin (Charles the Great's son), the Bishop Ratoldo and the Archideacon Pacifico decided to build a larger church and a monastery. The 8th of December 806 the new basilica was consecrated in the presence of King Pépin.\n
At the end of the 11th century new works to enlarge and renew the church were started: almost all the present basilica dates back to this period.
An earthquake in 1117 interrupted the renovation and destroyed much of what had been done till then: the cloister, the upper part of the bell tower and part of the monastery collapsed. The works were resumed soon after and lasted till 1138.\n
The monastery of San Zeno was shut down by the Republic of Venice in 1770.\n

It was built in 1476-93 according to the city elders' will of the municipal district of Verona. It was the seat of the meetings of the Citizens' council (as a matter of fact just a formal institution because the Venetian rule prohibited any actual autonomy to the town).\n
In '800 the council was temporarily used as civil picture gallery and in order to allocate it to such a purpose it was dramatically rebuilt in 1820-38 and in 1870-74. The internal part (floors, ceilings, and painting decorations were changed) and the building was filled up with medallions and busts dedicated to Veronese important people (it was called the “promoteca”, established in 1810 and consisting in 110 carved pictures now preserved in the Civic Library in Verona).\n
Veronese humanists made the façade of the council, while the pictorial decoration, which covered the whole surface (the present one was remade in 1870), was made by Comacine artists. The building shows a porch with eight round arches while the first floor we can see four wide double lancet windows (a carved pediment and carved respond plasters).\n

Located on a site within the antique walls that join Piazza Bra and Castelvecchio, the museum was conceived as a sort of access garden to the Philharmonic Academy. Since 1612, the Academy had acquired some 28 epigraphs which were displayed in the courtyard in front of its building.\n

It is the place where the people from Verona like strolling for more than two centuries – along the Liston: between 1770 and 1782 it was paved with red marble from Valpolicella, the same used to build the Roman Amphitheatre.\n
It is the place where people meet to talk about daily events or to drink a coffee or a cocktail in one of the numerous bars, which are open even in winter.\n
The Liston gives evidence of the vitality of the city and represents the frame of the many events which take place in Piazza Brà or in the Arena. It was made even more spectacular by the new iron structures which support the colourful marquee tents. They were designed by the master Franco Zeffirelli and planned by the architect Gualtiero Rizzi.
