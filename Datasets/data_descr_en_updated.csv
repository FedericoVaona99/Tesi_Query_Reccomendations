200,en,"The theologian John Mbiti writes: “In Africa I am because we are”. Meaning that only the sense of belonging to a concrete community gives to the individual the elements necessary to define his/her full identity. 
Feeling part of the eternal cosmic cycle of life, within which one spends one’s entire existence, life in Africa is under stood as a journey which – marked by specific steps (celebrated by “rites of passage”) – ends up in returning to that “world of the ances- tors and of the spirits” to which everyone  is destined.
This explains the reason why in all African cultures the themes of life, fertility, physical and mental health, human relationships and others have great importance and are celebrated in various ways.
This also explains the significance of the didactic and ethnographic journey followed by the  African Museum of the Comboni Missionaries, renewed in its content and topics described by the traditional artefacts and traditional handmade objects displayed in the windows; by monothematic exhibitions and by the photos and video-clips constantly running on the large and smaller screens set up inside the museum's halls.
Students have also the chance to learn and to develop  skills  by participating in didactic laboratories  organised for them in collaboration with PM - Il Piccolo Missionario, the magazine for children.
The African Museum has a threefold aim: to help visitors to meet, to know and to love Africa, that continent far away as well as the one present among us today in Italy. It is the hope and the desire of the curators of the Museum that the great richness of African cultures here expressed may be perceived and appreciated by all those who choose to visit the permanent exhibition.",86

The prehistoric and botanical sections have been moved to the Command Headquarters building at the former Austrian Arsenal. Scientific materials gathered by museum researchers as well as by many naturalists over nearly five centuries, are now meticously prepared and catalogued before being studied and conserved in the collections or put on exhibit.
The museum, thus, plays an active and crucial role in scientific research and in publishing essays and popular texts.
Undoubtedly, the museum's flagship section is the famous Bolca fossils collection which includes specimens of more than 250 species of animals and 200 species of vegetals from the Lessini mountains at 50 kilometres from Verona a telling prove of what life on Earth was like 50 million years ago, and how it evolved.",88

203,en,"After various renovations, Palazzo della Ragione, one of the most significant and central buildings in the city, from April 12, 2014 is the new venue for the Achille Forti Gallery of Modern Art.
The Palazzo, which has always been the heart of the city, now for the first time hosts the city collections together with those of the Fondazione Cariverona and the Fondazione Domus.
This monumental group of buildings, which includes the Torre dei Lamberti, the Cappella dei Notai, and the Scala della Ragione, is now newly open to the city and its visitors. In its four magnificent rooms, hung with masterpieces from the collection, they can discover extraordinary works from 1840 to 1940 that recount the history of Verona, its collections, and their relationship with the city. Among these works are Meditazione by Francesco Hayez, and paintings by Giovanni Fattori, Angelo Morbelli, Felice Casorati , Guido Trentini, Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Gino Rossi, Filippo de Pisis, Giorgio Morandi, as well as sculptures by Medardo Rosso, and Arturo Martini.
The new gallery bears the name of the great patron Achille Forti (1887-1937): a botanist of middleclass origins, this notable citizen left the greater part of his assets, the building where he lived, and his art collection to the city of Verona.
Thanks to various donations and an acquisitions programme which have enlarged this original nucleus, today the gallery of modern art in Palazzo della Ragione presents itself to Verona and its vast international public immensely enriched, and it confirms that it is one of the locations offering the greatest variety and quality of Italy's visual and artistic heritage.",95

In ancient times it overlooked the Via Postumia. The arch was differently used by the Veronese until 1805 when the French troops dismantled it to enlarge the north-eastern entrance gate to the town.
In 1932 the monument was re-assembled on the green open space next to Castelvecchio where it can be admired today.
Classic style columns, tympanums, capitals and friezes embellish the four fronts while the niches on the two main sides of the arch originally contained marble statues – no longer extant – of important members of the gens Gavia.",20

Built probably in the I century BC on the Via Postumia (its urban stretch coinciding with the Decumanus Maximu) and renovated in the I century AD, Porta Borsari was the main entrance gate to the town and its representative function was emphasized by reach ornamental decorations.
Porta Borsari was a rectangular building with a central courtyard and double passageways alongside the façades: only the external prospect in local white limestone remains.",33

The foundations of a former masonry bridge had possibly been already laid by the Romans in the I century BC; it was surely rebuilt by the Romans in the II and III centuries AD and its two surviving arches are still visible on the left-hand side.
In 1298 Alberto I Della Scala rebuilt the right arch and the tower, while the second tower that was on the opposite bridgehead was demolished in 1801.
The two central arches date back to a further reconstruction in the early XVI century. In 1945 retreating German troops made the bridge blow-up; it was thus necessary to reconstruct it by recovering some of its original stones and bricks from the Adige River where the explosion had hurled them.",47
47,en,"The theatre was built on the hills of St. Peter in the middle of Augustinian age. It was a building of spectacular grandeur which spread from the left bank of the Adige to the top of the hill and was complementing the Roman town planning system on the right bank of the river.
Over centuries many civil and religious buildings were erected on the theatre's ruins; in 1834 a rich Veronese merchant, Andrea Monga, bought at this own expense some of the houses that were built in the area of the theatre in order to begin archaeological excavations, which brought to light ruins of the Roman building.
The theatre respects the architectural canons of this building type: the seating area for spectators, divided in two sections and vertically in wedges; the semi-circular orchestra at the foot of the staircase; the stage, for the actors. During the summer the theatre hosts numerous theatrical and musical events (Estate Teatrale Veronese).
In 1923 the Archaeological Museum was established in the rooms of the ex-monastery of  St. Jerome, which had been built over the theatre in the late 15th century. Sacred inscriptions and tombs, mosaics, sculptures and everyday utensils from Verona and its province are exhibited there.",83

It is one of the largest amphitheatre in Italy; its elliptical shape produces perfect acoustics from any stand point and allows it to accommodate a large number of spectators. The most solemn monument in Roman Verona, with various orders of tiers of seats and, in the centre, an area or arena for gladiator shows, struggles with wild beasts and other events of a popular nature, was built with well-squared blocks of marble in the 1st century A.D., namely between the end of the empire of Augustus and the empire of Claudius.",98
50,en,"The castle, an imposing civic building from the medieval Veronese period, was built between 1354 and 1356 by order of Cangrande II della Scala. The design was conceived by the della Scala family as a defence against both outside invasions and popular rebellion.The surrounding area allowed for a rapid and easy escape from the city: after crossing the fortified bridge, accessible only to the noble family, the road to the north along the Adige valley was a secure route.The city’s geographically strategic location led to the development of a fortification system, consolidating the remains of the Roman and Commune periods.
In 1404, following the brief Carrara and Visconti dominations, the city became part of the Venetian Republic. The castle was used exclusively for military purposes, as a weapons and munitions warehouse and subsequently, in the eighteenth century, became the seat of the Venetian military academy.
In the days of the anti-French revolt known as the “Pasque Veronesi” (1797) the castle was the site of numerous armed engagements. The Napoleonic epoch marked the beginning of a radical transformation of the existing structure. The plan provided for the construction of an army barracks around three sides of the drill court, but only those sections along the river and towards the Palazzo Canossa were built. This building, in neo-classical style, continued to serve a military function in the Austrian epoch.
Only after 1923 did the castle cease to serve an exclusively military function. It underwent a dramatic structural change, following plans by Antonio Avena, director of the Civic Museums, and the architect Ferdinando Forlati: the reconstruction of the swallowtail battlements, the insertion of late Gothic and Renaissance decorative elements in the facades, and extension of the pictorial decoration in “period” style. Beginning in 1925 the castle became a museum, where valuable art collections were installed.
Beginning in 1957, under the direction of Licisco Maganato a new organisation of the entire building was planned, to restore the value of the notable historical and artistic patrimonies. This critical and historical revision favoured authenticity, and thus eliminated the false contexts created in the previous renovation. The task of restoration and museum installation was entrusted to the architect Carlo Scarpa, whose highly original solution is universally recognised as one of the finest examples of museum renovation of post-war Italy.
The Museum also holds temporary exhibitions in its Boggian Room (inside the courtyard, on the right).",30
52,en,"The Cathedral, which is dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta, is the central structure of a complex of architectural buildings which include San Giovanni in Fonte, Santa Elena, the Canons' cloister, the Capitular library, the square in front of the church and the bishop's residence.
During the Roman Empire, in the area of the present day church, there were villas with private thermal baths (balnea) and probably also a few small temples.
The first palaeo Christian basilica was built on the area occupied today by the church of Santa Elena. 
It was consecrated by S. Zeno, bishop of Verona, between 362 380 A.D. but it soon turned out to be too small and a few decades later it was replaced by a larger basilica. Quite a few remains of the mosaic floor of both palaeo Christian basilicas can be seen under the church of Santa Elena and the Canons' cloister.
The second palaeo christian basilica collapsed, probably during the 7th century A.D., due to a strong fire or maybe an earthquake. Archdeacon Pacifico was in charge of the reconstruction of the church, between the 8th and the 9th century and the Cathedral, known by the name of Santa Maria Matricolare, was built further south, on the area on which it is situated today.
The church was greatly damaged by an earthquake in 1117 A.D. The reconstruction work lasted at least 20 years: the building acquired its current width and the two Romanesque porches.
The inside was completely renovated between the second half of the 15th and the second half of the 16th century with the addition of the side chapels and the semicircular choir screen.
Note outside the Romanesque façade, Nicolò double level porch (1138), the portal with its lunette and reliefs, the splendid side porch and the apse area. Inside the church you can see: the chapels with works by Falconetto, Liberale, Giolfino, Torbido, Titian's Assumption of the Virgin (1530) and Sammicheli's original choir screen.",37

Work lasted throughout the 14th and 15th centuries and by the early years of the 16th century the final stages of building showed that the end was in sight. The only thing never to be completed was the façade. St. Anastasia is the largest church in Verona.
The Basilica extends over three large aisles supported by twelve impressive pillars in red Veronese marble. To the left of the transept a splendid marble entrance opens onto the Giusti chapel which was at one time the oratory of the Dominican monastery.
The church soars to a great height and the interior is impressive; it is virtually an art gallery which contains many of the works of art Masters often mentioned in art history books. The most important is Pisanello’s well known fresco (St. George and the Princess) above Pellegrini Chapel. Note outside he unfinished façade with the splendid Gothic portal. Inside, you can see altars and chapels with works by Pietro da Porlezza, Cattaneo, Michele da Firenze, LiIberale da Verona, Girolamo dai Libri, Giolfino, Brusasorzi, Altichiero and  Pisanello; at the entrance the singular hunchbacks of the holy water stoup.",40

As well as several sarcophagi, we find the three splendid arches built for Cangrande I, Mastino II and Cansignorio, by artists from different areas.

58,en,"Palazzo della Ragione, located between beautiful Piazza delle Erbe and Piazza dei Signori, has always been the pulsating heart of Verona.
It is a corner of the city in which various buildings have, over the centuries, been juxtaposed to create a monumental complex that has symbolized, and still symbolizes, the ancient centre.
After various renovations, this majestic twelfth-century building has been made available to the public once more.
Not only can its architectural and monumental aspects be fully enjoyed, but it has also become the centre of Veronese culture by hosting the Achille Forti gallery of modern art; here, for the first time, the gallery's collection of visual art has been united to the collections of the Fondazione Cariverona and the Fondazione Domus to offer the public both a history and an account of public and private collecting.
With this project the Verona city council, together with the Fondazione Cariverona, has made newly available to the city, its inhabitants, and an international public a place that is emblematic of the city and its history.
This complex of buildings, whose history, intertwined with that of city life, reaches down the centuries, has today been renewed and given back its rightful place as an organic and harmonic whole, a single body of which the elements composing it are united together: the Palazzo, a symbol of city power; the Torre dei Lamberti, which rises up as an emblem of temporal power; the decorated treasure house of the Cappella dei Notai; and the Scala della Ragione, the heart of the Mercato Vecchio courtyard.
The Lamberti tower, built in the twelfth century and so being the same age as the first stages of the Palazzo's construction, rises to 84 metres high and offers a fascinating view of the city and its surroundings; for the Veronese it is a familiar landmark and a visual reference point for the landscape and the city panorama.
The courtyard, surrounded by a portico with arches supported by rustic ashlar pillars, is characterized by the colours of alternate courses of bricks and tuff stone. Inside the wide area of the Mercato Vecchio courtyard is the Scala della Ragione, a late gothic jewel built from red Veronese marble which leads the public to the great portal of the first floor, now the new, central access point to the Palazzo's gallery of modern art.
This stairway allows a new internal itinerary and, above all, restores the centrality that Camillo Boito had conferred on it at the end of the nineteenth century, restoring it to the ideal role that it originally had.
The choice of the Palazzo as the venue for the gallery should be considered a genuine restitution of art to Palazzo della Ragione: in fact in the nineteenth century the first floor was home to the Cignaroli academy of fine art, as is also born out  by the fresco, an allegory of Verona among the Arts, by Giovanni Bevilacqua on the porch at the top of the stairway.",53

The identification of the Cappellos with the Capulets gave birth to the idea that there stood the House of Juliet, Shakespeare's tragic heroine.
This medieval dwelling, picturesquelly restored by Antonio Avena around the mid '30s, was allocated for temporary exhibitions in the recent past.

62,en,"On the banks of the river Adige, out of the Roman porta Leoni, in the same place where the saints Fermo and Rustico were tortured to death in 304, people built a church in the 5th-6th c. in honour of them.
Between 755 and 759 St. Annone, the bishop of Verona, recovered from Trieste the mortal remains of the two martyrs and placed them in the Palaeo-Christian church into a “confessione”, the specific place in which people pay honour to the martyrs who have confessed the faith in Christ.
Between 1065 and 1143 the Benedictine monks demolished the Palaeo-Christian church and, to conserve the relics in the same place in which St. Annone had placed them, they built a Romanesque church on two levels: the lower church to keep the relics, the upper to be used for religious functions.
In 1261 the complex was handed over to the Franciscans, who transformed the upper church into its present form. The work of reconstruction was concluded in the year 1350. Throughout the following centuries, altars, chapels and sepulchral monuments were added.
In 1759 the sarcophagus with the mortal remains of the Martyrs was moved to the main altar of the upper church, in order to protect it from the flooding of the river Adige.
In 1807 the Franciscans were obliged to leave the monastery because of the Napoleonic conquest. A large part of the monastery passed to the State and the church became a parish assigned to diocesan clergy.
Note outside, the portal with the arches on the sides and the area outside the apse. Inside the upper church you can see the superb ribbed vault wooden ceiling and 14th and 15th century frescoes, works by Turone, Torbido , Stefano and Liberale da Verona, F.Caroto and a fresco by Pisanello. The lower Church, rare because of its 4 naves, is Romanesque and the upper Gothic.",65
63,en,"The Basilica of San Zeno is without any doubt one of the most beautiful and better preserved examples of Romanesque architecture in the whole of Northern Italy. What strikes the visitor most is the warm colours of the façade, due to the alternated use of tufa stone and bricks.
The original nucleus of the complex has been identified in the church and convent that rose on the Roman and later an early Christian burial ground near the Via Gallica. The church and convent had been built on the spot where the Saint had been buried, in order to preserve his relics and honor his memory. Saint Zeno, born in Africa, 8th Bishop of Verona (362-380), converted the whole town to Christianity.
The early buildings underwent some changes in the 6th century. The church soon became too small, due to the ever growing worship of the Saint. For this reason, the Frankish King Pépin (Charles the Great's son), the Bishop Ratoldo and the Archideacon Pacifico decided to build a larger church and a monastery. The 8th of December 806 the new basilica was consecrated in the presence of King Pépin.
At the end of the 11th century new works to enlarge and renew the church were started: almost all the present basilica dates back to this period.
An earthquake in 1117 interrupted the renovation and destroyed much of what had been done till then: the cloister, the upper part of the bell tower and part of the monastery collapsed. The works were resumed soon after and lasted till 1138.
The monastery of San Zeno was shut down by the Republic of Venice in 1770.
Note on the outside the façade with the large rose window called “The wheel of Fortune”, the marble bas-reliefs on either side of the porch, the famous bronze doors, the bell-tower and the Abbey Tower.
Inside the church you can see 13th and 14th century frescoes, the baptismal font, the ribbed vault ceiling, the crypt where the remains of San Zeno are kept, the polychromatic statue of San Zeno called “San Zeno laughing” and Andrea Mantegna's famous Triptych (1457-59).",74

Following radical restoration work, since 1928 it has housed the museum of Veronese art and sculpture from the Middle Ages onwards. 
Damaged during the Second World War, it was restored by architect Carlo Scarpa, and the museum was re-organised: an intervention (1957-1964) that is considered to be an important example of museum science at an international level. The museum also holds temporary exhibitions in its Boggian Room (inside the courtyard, on the right).",5
72,en,"The “Loggia del Consiglio” was also called the “Fra Giocondo's Council” because it was wrongly attributed to the famous Veronese architect “Fra Giocondo”. It was built in 1476-93 according to the city elders' will of the municipal district of Verona. It was the seat of the meetings of the Citizens' council (as a matter of fact just a formal institution because the Venetian rule prohibited any actual autonomy to the town).
In '800 the council was temporarily used as civil picture gallery and in order to allocate it to such a purpose it was dramatically rebuilt in 1820-38 and in 1870-74. The internal part (floors, ceilings, and painting decorations were changed) and the building was filled up with medallions and busts dedicated to Veronese important people (it was called the “promoteca”, established in 1810 and consisting in 110 carved pictures now preserved in the Civic Library in Verona).
Veronese humanists made the façade of the council, while the pictorial decoration, which covered the whole surface (the present one was remade in 1870), was made by Comacine artists. The building shows a porch with eight round arches while the first floor we can see four wide double lancet windows (a carved pediment and carved respond plasters).
At the top of the building there are the statues of renowned people of Roman Verona (Catullo, Plinio, Emilio Macro, Vitruvius and Cornelio Nepote), made by Alberto da Milano.
Inside the council rooms we can see some paintings commissioned by the Council in the XVI century; some other paintings of '500 and '600 were transferred to Barbieri Palace or were destroyed. The painting by Giambettino Cignaroli depicting Pomponio Trionfatore, dating half '700 is still intact.
The Council open gallery is now the seat of the meetings of the provincial council and of various cultural events.
On the arch that connects the Council open gallery to the Casa della Pietà (Mercy House), which was rebuilt in 1490 on residences dating back to the Scaliger period, it is situated the statue of Girolamo Fracastoro (famous Veronese doctor, poet and autonomous), carved by Danese Cattaneo in 1559.",100

Located on a site within the antique walls that join Piazza Bra and Castelvecchio, the museum was conceived as a sort of access garden to the Philharmonic Academy. Since 1612, the Academy had acquired some 28 epigraphs which were displayed in the courtyard in front of its building.
The initial transformation of this collection into an established museum was due to the efforts of Scipione Maffei; the museum was subsequently acquired by the city in 1883 and equipped following the modern standards in 1982.",77

It is the place where the people from Verona like strolling for more than two centuries – along the Liston: between 1770 and 1782 it was paved with red marble from Valpolicella, the same used to build the Roman Amphitheatre.
It is the place where people meet to talk about daily events or to drink a coffee or a cocktail in one of the numerous bars, which are open even in winter.
The Liston gives evidence of the vitality of the city and represents the frame of the many events which take place in Piazza Brà or in the Arena. It was made even more spectacular by the new iron structures which support the colourful marquee tents. They were designed by the master Franco Zeffirelli and planned by the architect Gualtiero Rizzi. The Palazzo della Gran Guardia hosts important cultural events, while Palazzo Barbieri is the seat of Verona Town Hall.
An old clock, which was donated by the count Antonio Nogarola and set between the two arches of the XIVth century Portoni della Brà, indicates the time to the strollers.
About in the mid of the XIIth century the market of wood, hay and cattle was held in the wide empty space around the Arena. This event became permanent between the XVIIIth and XIXth centuries. In 1897 the square hosted the most important horse Fair of the North-East. Nowadays it is one of the most important in Europe.
Ancient documents refer to Piazza Brà as “foro boario”: this tradition survives thanks to the fair of Santa Lucia which takes place here every year. The place then was urbanized: different activities began and buildings were built between the XVIth and the XVIIIth centuries.

The alternating courses of brick and stone create striking stripes on the interior walls and columns; the bell tower dates to 1468, and the façade is distinguished by two turrets with cylindrical staircases leading to an upper gallery traditionally used by women. 
The church preserves a 1566 main altarpiece by Domenico Brusasorci, fragments of 13th–14th-century frescoes, and works associated with Nicolò Giolfino, among others.",
73,en,"San Giorgio in Braida is a Catholic church in Verona’s Veronetta quarter, bounded by the Adige to the south and Borgo Trento to the north. Its origins date to 1046, when Pietro Cadalo—later an antipope—endowed a Benedictine monastery under the bishop of Verona; after prosperity in the 12th–13th centuries, faint traces of the early Romanesque building—likely rebuilt after the 1117 earthquake—survive, such as the base of the bell tower along the left wall. In 1442 the complex passed to the Congregation of San Giorgio in Alga, which began the present Renaissance church; after the order’s suppression it was sold in 1669 to the nuns of Santa Maria in Reggio to help finance the War of Candia.
Closed in 1807, the convent was largely demolished in 1837 during Austrian fortification works; San Giorgio regained parish status on 2 March 1874 and underwent restoration in 1938, including partial reconstruction of the 16th-century cloister. The design—often credited to Francesco da Castello, with a contribution by Paolo Farinati for the façade—includes the great dome and the conception of the campanile by Michele Sanmicheli (continued but not completed by Bernardino Brugnoli).
Inside, a single nave with eight side chapels (each with a white-marble altar and wooden superstructure) and a shallow transept beneath the dome houses works by Giovan Francesco Caroto, Domenico and Felice Brusasorzi, Pasquale Ottino, Girolamo dai Libri, Sigismondo de Stefani, and Francesco Montemezzano; under the organ loft is Moretto’s Madonna in Glory, above the main door Tintoretto’s Baptism of Christ, and in the apse Paolo Veronese’s Martyrdom of Saint George (1564).",
79,en,"Santa Maria Antica is a Roman Catholic church in Verona; the present Romanesque building dates to 1185, rebuilt after the 1117 earthquake, with a fragment of black-and-white mosaic floor surviving from the 7th-century predecessor.
Dedicated by the patriarch of Aquileia, it served as the private chapel of the Scaligeri, whose 13th-century funerary complex adjoins the site. The exterior alternates tuff and brick with small windows; a modest Romanesque bell tower with mullioned openings and a brick-clad spire holds three 17th-century bells rung in the Veronese style.
The three-aisled interior was Baroquized c. 1630 but restored at the end of the 19th century to a Romanesque scheme with stilted arches and a trussed roof supported by transverse arches, recalling San Zeno. Two lateral apses in tuff and brick flank a central apse that preserves early 14th-century frescoes.
Excavations revealed an adjacent cemetery with around fifty 11th-century burials.",
110,en,"The Gardello Tower stands near Piazza delle Erbe in Verona, on the site of an earlier house-tower likely owned by the Gardello family. In 1370 Cansignorio della Scala had it restored and raised—possibly to plans by Giovanni da Ferrara—and installed a bell clock that for the first time in Verona struck the hours, as commemorated by a Latin plaque.
The external clock hands and dial were added in 1421, and only in 1661 (or perhaps later in the 18th century) did another public clock with a dial appear in the city, on the taller Torre dei Lamberti. In 1626 the tower was slightly heightened with a truncated-cone roof, reaching a final height of 44 m. The belfry is recognizable by its biforate (twin-light) windows with central colonnettes; the original 1.8-ton bell, bearing the city arms, St Zeno and Gothic inscriptions, cast by Master Jacopo, is preserved at the Castelvecchio Museum.",
53,en,"The Verona Chapter Library (Biblioteca Capitolare), set within the cathedral complex, is widely regarded as the oldest library still in operation and has belonged to the Cathedral Chapter since its foundation. It grew out of the 5th-century scriptorium of the Schola majoris Ecclesiae; a colophon by the lector Ursicino dated 1 August 517 attests early activity, while even older codices—such as Augustine’s De civitate Dei and the unique Institutes of Gaius—suggest a 4th-century origin.
The collection flourished during the Carolingian renaissance under Archdeacon Pacificus, when the scriptorium produced some 218 volumes. By the early 13th century it functioned as a lending library; in 1320 Dante was invited to deliver the Quaestio de aqua et terra at nearby Sant’Elena, and in 1345 Petrarch, consulting here, reported discovering Cicero’s letters to Atticus, Quintus, and Brutus. After the holdings were hidden and forgotten during the 1630 plague, Scipione Maffei and Canon Carlo Carinelli oversaw their rediscovery in 1712 and the opening of a new hall in 1725 (enlarged in 1781), though Napoleon later seized 31 codices and 20 incunabula, only some of which returned in 1816. Despite the 1882 Adige flood and the Allied bombing of 4 January 1945—mitigated by librarian Giuseppe Turrini, who safeguarded the most precious items—the library resumed in a rebuilt home inaugurated on 28 September 1948; among later scholarly milestones is Luigi Schiaparelli’s 1924 identification of the “Veronese Riddle,” an early witness to the Italian vernacular.",
57,en,"Palazzo del Capitanio takes its name from its role under the Venetian Republic (1405–1796) as the seat of the Capitano veneto, before housing judicial offices from the late nineteenth century.
Previously it had been a Scaliger residence, gradually enlarged on the site of the dynasty’s earliest houses and enriched with painted decoration—some still in situ, others detached in the nineteenth century and now in the Museo di Castelvecchio. The tower facing Piazza dei Signori preserves its medieval character and was built in the late thirteenth century, possibly at the initiative of Alberto I della Scala. It was therefore a relatively recent construction at the time of Dante’s stay in Verona.",
75,en,"Giardino Giusti is an urban garden complex of notable interest and beauty in Verona, long visited and praised by distinguished figures from history and culture. Created in the late fifteenth century, it largely preserves the layout given by Agostino Giusti, a Knight of the Venetian Republic and gentleman to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Conceived as a scenic backdrop to Palazzo Giusti, the garden is articulated in terraces that progressively open views of the city along a prearranged route.
Opposite the sixteenth-century atrium, the famed cypress avenue climbs to a stalactite grotto surmounted by a theatrical mascherone built to emit tongues of fire from its mouth. From the belvedere, visitors enjoy one of Verona’s most celebrated panoramas.",
100,en,"Porta Nuova is a monumental gateway to Verona’s historic center, built between 1532 and 1540 under the direction of Michele Sanmicheli as part of a major renewal of the city’s southern fortifications. Conceived at the juncture of ceremony and defense, it fuses the representational language of Renaissance civic architecture with the functional requirements of a military work.
The design draws on elevated classical models while adapting them to the practicalities of a modernized enceinte. Its massing and disciplined articulation underscore both urban dignity and strategic control of movement. The gate was highly esteemed by Giorgio Vasari, who praised it in the Lives as an achievement of exceptional scale and intelligence.",
101,en,"Porta San Zeno is a monumental city gate in Verona, commissioned in 1542 to the design of the Veronese architect Michele Sanmicheli. Sanmicheli prepared the project in 1541 after returning from travels in the eastern Mediterranean, and two inscriptions on the front and rear façades (both dated 1542) indicate an exceptionally rapid construction, completed in less than a year.
The site was newly determined, set between the earlier medieval portals: Porta Nova (also called Santo Zenone) to the north, where roads from Brescia and Chievo converged, and Porta San Massimo to the south, on the road of the same name. The gate thus established a new access point within the city’s wall system, reflecting updated traffic routes and urban organization in the mid-sixteenth century.",
102,en,"Porta Palio is a monumental city gate in Verona, erected between 1550 and 1561 to designs by Michele Sanmicheli, and often cited as the most ambitious Renaissance meditation on the triumphal city gateway—the clearest architectural expression of the policy to “munire et ornare” (fortify and adorn). The project was first urged in the 1530s by Francesco Maria I della Rovere, who sought to replace the vulnerable medieval Porta del Palio with a new cavalier gate aligned with the principal thoroughfare tracing the ancient Via Postumia, and defensible from Castel San Felice; Sanmicheli and his nephew Giangirolamo were named as designers. Although the old gate was closed around 1538 (opened only for the palio) and finally bricked up in 1546, works on the new structure began only in 1550 and the gate opened in 1561, still short of the original scheme, which envisaged a frontispiece doubling as an artillery platform. 
A 1571 report records that the building rose to only about half the intended height and carried a temporary roof; Sanmicheli had planned an additional level so the gate could operate fully as a cavalier commanding the surrounding ground. Despite its limited practical utility—open mainly in summer and never used as a true cavalier—the work is celebrated as a masterpiece of military architecture, praised by Sforza Pallavicino as without equal in Europe and by Giorgio Vasari as “new, strange, and beautiful.”",
45,en,"Scavi Scaligeri (Scaligeri Excavations) is an urban archaeological site beneath and around the Palazzo del Capitanio complex near Piazza dei Signori, opened up during restoration works in the late 1970s and leaving Roman and medieval remains visible in situ. The area spans the palace courtyard, Via Dante, and part of the Palazzo della Ragione, making it one of the largest urban archaeological zones in northern Italy.
In Roman times it was occupied by houses repeatedly remodeled until the fifth century; after abandonment and garden use into the tenth century, an eleventh-century cemetery of Santa Maria Antica was established here, and in the thirteenth Alberto I della Scala appropriated the land for the family palaces. Visitors enter from the Cortile del Tribunale and follow an evocative, non-chronological route past a floor mosaic with geometric and animal motifs, remains of a domus and public buildings, a limestone-paved street, and a brick-vaulted sewer dating to the mid-first century.
Medieval layers include two tombs from the Santa Maria Antica cemetery, a cellar from Alberto I’s palace, the foundations of a square house-tower, and wall segments from different phases; a Lombard double burial with grave goods was also found. Restored under the Veronese architect Libero Cecchini, the complex was adapted in 1996 as the Centro Internazionale di Fotografia Scavi Scaligeri, an exhibition venue hosting photography shows, workshops, and educational programs.",

2,en,"Verona Porta Nuova is the city’s principal railway station, close to the center, and entered service in 1852 when the first train from Venice—hauled by the locomotive Verona—crossed the new railway bridge over the Adige. Initially secondary to Porta Vescovo for military-logistical reasons, it soon became a junction as lines to Mantua (1853), Brescia (1854), the Brenner (1859), Rovigo (1877), and Bologna (1924) converged here.
A larger passenger building was planned in the early twentieth century: work to architect Dini’s design began in 1910, with a provisional opening in 1913 and a formal inauguration on 22 March 1922, its interiors decorated with mosaics by the Venetian artisan Amedeo Mantellato. Severely damaged by Allied bombing during the Second World War, the station was rebuilt on the same alignment to the designs of Roberto Narducci between 1946 and 1949, reopening on 13 March 1949 with extensive cladding in Veronese marbles.
The complex retains a characteristic split-level arrangement created by the elevated tracks (public services at ground level, railway operations above), with Liberty-inspired metal canopies on the platforms and 1990s refurbishments adding new volumes and shopfronts toward the station square.",
3,en,"Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi is Verona’s principal multi-purpose stadium and the home ground of Hellas Verona; with an overall capacity of about 39,000 (roughly 31,000 approved), it ranks among Italy’s larger venues.

The facility includes an eight-lane athletics track, comprehensively renewed in 2010 with a new blue-and-yellow surface also used for skating. Enlarged and roofed ahead of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, it hosted Group E matches and a Round-of-16 tie, and over the decades has staged youth fixtures, rugby, athletics meetings and occasional concerts. Historic crowds peaked in the 1980s—47,896 for Verona–Roma in 1983—and the ground witnessed Hellas Verona’s 1984–85 Scudetto as well as Chievo’s first promotion in 2000–01.
