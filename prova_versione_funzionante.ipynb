    "## 11. Conclusions & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook re-implemented the K-LaMP framework for **personalized contextual query suggestion**.  \n",
    "The workflow demonstrated:  \n",
    "1. Loading and merging datasets (POIs, descriptions, user profiles).  \n",
    "2. Building a **memory stream** of user interactions (queries, POI views, ORCID keywords).  \n",
    "3. Constructing an **entity store** to aggregate entities with counts and timestamps.  \n",
    "4. Designing prompt builders (original K-LaMP vs. enhanced version with profile integration).  \n",
    "5. Using the **Gemini API** to generate next-query suggestions under different scenarios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Entity-centric personalization, especially when combined with **ORCID profiles** and user attributes, yields richer and more relevant query recommendations compared to a baseline prompt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Future directions:**  \n",
    "- Develop automatic evaluation metrics to quantify personalization quality.   \n",
    "- Investigate alternative retrieval strategies (familiar, unfamiliar, lapsed) and dynamic weighting schemes.  \n",
    "- Assess scalability on larger and more diverse user datasets, including longer interaction histories.  \n"
